# Audio Data Collection

## Overview
This repository contains my work for an audio data collection lab focused on understanding the intricacies of audio data through collection, labeling, feature extraction, and cleaning. It details the process of working with the UrbanSound8K dataset, specifically targeting aspects of audio quality and processing.

## Lab Description
The lab was structured around handling real-world audio data challenges, including data quality assessment, feature extraction, and ethical data collection protocols. It involved working with different classes of urban sounds, understanding their unique characteristics, and preparing them for analysis.

## Lab Tasks
- **Task 1:** Collection and Quality Assessment of Audio Data from UrbanSound8K.
- **Task 2:** Labeling and Frequency Analysis of Audio Files.
- **Task 3:** Feature Extraction and Data Cleaning, outputting a detailed CSV file.
- **Task 4:** Planning and Protocol Development for Ethical Audio Data Collection.

## Libraries and Tools Used
- **Python:** For all scripting and automation tasks.
- **LibROSA:** A Python package for music and audio analysis, used for feature extraction.
- **Pandas:** For organizing and cleaning data in Python.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For generating frequency plots and visualizations.

## Repository Contents
- **Scripts:** Python scripts for each task, with comments explaining the process and methodology.
- **CSV File:** The final cleaned and processed data set with extracted features.
- **Report:** A detailed document reflecting on the tasks, methodologies, and insights gained.

## Conclusion and Reflection
This lab was an intensive exploration into audio data collection and analysis, emphasizing the practical skills needed to work with real-world audio data and the importance of ethical considerations in data collection.
